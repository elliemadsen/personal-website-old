        <h3>Semantic Search</h3>
        <p>
          As a software engineer at Pinterest, I specialize in the retrieval
          infrastructure domain, specifically embedding graphs. Pinterest is a
          platform for searching and collecting images. Embedding retrieval is
          used to recommend users visually or semantically similar images.
          <br /><br />
          An embedding is a numerical vector trained using a neural network to
          represent arbitrary data in multidimensional space. Two vectors nearby
          in space, as computed via a distance metric such as dot product, means
          the data they represent are also similar.
        </p>
        <div class="d-flex flex-column align-items-center">
          <img
            src="img/pinterest/pinterest-space.png"
            alt="Image of "
            width="80%"
            class="pad"
          />
        </div>

        <p>
          K-Nearest-Neighbors (KNN) search finds the closest K embeddings to a
          given query embedding. However, computing the distance for all
          embeddings in the data set is infeasible for Pinterest's billion-scale
          datasets.
          <br /><br />
          Approximate-Nearest-Neighbors (ANN) is an approximate embedding search
          solution that trades off accuracy for efficiency. Hierarchical
          Navigable Small World Graphs (HNSW) are a multi-layer graphs that can
          quickly refine the entire embedding space to a specific target area.
          The base layer0 contains all nodes, while each layern+1 contains a
          subset of nodes in layern. The algorithm traverses the graph at every
          layer, using the local minimum of layern+1 as the entry point to
          layern. Many parameters, such as graph connectivity and heap size, can
          be tuned to optimize the accuracy-efficiency trade-off. I help users
          build and deploy new HNSW graph indexes for custom data types, provide
          debugging support, develop new semantic search features (eg. Recall
          Monitoring, Quantization, 8-Bit Embeddings), and optimize retrieval
          efficiency.
        </p>

        <h3>Distributed Retrieval Architecture</h3>
        <p>
          Pinterest's retrieval system is hosted on a hierarchical distributed
          architecture. A root node fans out to many leaf shards, each of which
          contains multiple data segments. Replicas are added according to
          traffic fluctuations, thus creating a multi-level horizontal and
          vertical scalable system for large (TB) indexes and high (100k) QPS.
          <br /><br />
          I have performed optimizations across 20+ clusters to tune instance
          resources with the quantity of shards and segments. In 2023 I designed
          and implemented adaptive search parameters which automatically
          determine the number of documents to aggregate at the segment, leaf,
          and root levels. This affects the data overfetch at each level of the
          hierarchy, balancing efficiency and result quality.
          <br /><br />
          I've also developed data visualization tooling that includes an
          interactive representation of document distribution and a latency
          trace flame graph.
          <br /><br />
          Altogether, I have saved about $1M in annual cloud computing costs by
          improving retrieval efficiency with right-sizing, re-sharding, and
          funnel tuning.

        <h3>Recall Monitoring</h3>
        <p>
          In 2024 I designed and implemented an online recall metric that gives
          users live insight into recall across various attributes. Recall (the
          percent of ANN results that exist in the exact-KNN result set) is
          important to quantify the accuracy loss of ANN. I created a realtime
          recall metric logging pipeline that monitors instantaneous and gradual
          recall degradation or improvement across many distinct attributes. One
          project complexity was ensuring that in a non-isolated production
          environment, resource allocation for the computationally-intense KNN
          retrieval did not interfere with the main system's ANN functionality.
          To accommodate this, I implemented a series of safety mechanisms
          including parallel processing (threadpooling), asychronization
          (callback chains), rate limiting, request sampling and linear
          interpolation. After the launch, users are able to rapidly iterate on
          model and embedding versions with live results, while developers have
          insight into the quality impact of new features.
        </p>

        <h3>Quantization</h3>
        <p>
          In 2024 I worked on designing, implementing, and launching embedding
          quantization. A quantizer reduces the dimensions or precision of a
          vector, compressing it to a smaller size to significantly reduce
          embedding memory. Product quantization enables aggressive vector
          compression at the expense of precision loss. In offline training, the
          N-dimensional vector space is divided into D subspaces, each of which
          uses k-means to find M centroids. Next, each vector is encoded to a
          series of centroid IDs. Finally, during online retrieval, each code is
          reconstructed, or decoded, by mapping the centroid ID to the centroid
          vector.
          <br /><br />
          The diagram illustrates a simplified example of product quantization
          that achieves an 8x embedding size reduction.
          <br /><br />

          My contributions included: creating a quantization configuration API,
          designing a quantized embedding indexer and writer, integrating FAISS
          open-sourced quantization, training and encoding the quantizer,
          flushing the quantized embeddings to SSD, and performing integration
          testing. I benchmarked various configurations to assess impact on
          recall, latency, CPU, and memory before designing and executing an
          online A/B experiment. The quantization feature enabled large memory
          optimizations while maintaining neutral engagement and recall.

            class="pad"
          />
        </div>

        <h3>SIMD 8-bit Inner Product</h3>
        <p>
          As a precursor to quantization, I implemented support for 8-bit
          embeddings. Because the system computes ~100k distance computations
          per request and receives ~100k queries per second, the distance
          calculation must be highly optimized. I implemented 8-bit inner
          product using SIMD (single instruction multiple data), an efficient
          hardware-based parallel computing architecture. I wrote functions for
          for Intel processors with AVX intrinsics and for ARM processors with
          Neon intrinsics. The code processes 8 dimensions at a time, loads the
          values from memory to registers, converts to float to handle overflow,
          multiplies and accumulates the product, processes remainders, and
          finally normalizes output to [-1,1]. After implementing feature
          support, I conducted an A/B experiment that converted attributes from
          16 to 8 bits. It yielded neutral product metrics and recall, with 50%
          memory reduction and 40% CPU optimization of the distance computation.
        </p>

        <h3>Remote Model Inference</h3>
        <p>
          Machine learning inference applies a model to input data to generate
          an output prediction. At Pinterest, we use this technique during
          retrieval to predict the relevance and engagement scores of Pins and
          rank results by quality. After fetching and preparing data from the
          index, a model server runs machine learning models to compute a score
          for each data object. Historically, the model server that performs
          inference was embedded in the retrieval infrastructure system I work
          on, meaning that it shared resources with retrieval logic. In 2023 led
          a migration to move this predict computation to a remote server,
          instead of embedded within the same servers as retrieval. For this
          project I led the technical design and implementation, which included
          API and RPC design, code execution, cross-team project management,
          robust error handling, integration testing, A/B experimentation,
          rollout, and knowledge sharing. The following diagram illustrates the
          system architecture before and after the migration:
        </p>
        <p>
          This system includes two different types of servers: CPU and GPU. GPU
          processors are designed to quickly compute calculations in parallel,
          which makes them well-suited for machine learning inference. When
          retrieval and model inference were unified, we had to run the entire
          CPU-intensive system on GPU machines. My system design decoupled
          retrieval and inference into separate systems so that GPUs are
          reserved specifically for ML inference. This increased GPU utilization
          from 11% to 80%.
          <br /><br />
          Another efficiency improvement came from the sharding strategy.
          Retrieval is most efficient when distributed across many leaf nodes
          with small data shards. But model serving is most efficient on fewer
          nodes, because GPUs are optimized for high parallelization. By running
          model server on a single host, I achieved fewer queues per model that
          fill more quickly, so requests can be accumulated into larger parallel
          batches. This optimization increased average batch size from 5 to 160.
          <br /><br />
          After launching the migration, the system’s serving cost decreased by
          38%, which amounts to $1.5M of annual infra cost savings.
          Simultaneously, the retrieval index size grew by 37% while QPS
          increased by 20%. Tail latency was also reduced by 30%.
